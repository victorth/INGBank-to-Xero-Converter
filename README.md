# ING Bank to Xero bankstatement converter
A very simplistic tool that converts a ING Bank (the Netherlands) .csv file to a Xero readable format. The tool strips uncessary column and generates a clean and readable file.

## Instructions
1. Download a periods transactions from ING in a commat separated .csv format.
2. Put the file in the project folder.
3. Run ruby ing_to_xero.rb from the project folder.
4. Enter the file name when prompted and hit enter.
5. Profit!

## Support
Questions are more than welcome, but the script is provided as it is. The script will hopefully be improved to create a semi-automatic workflow to import bankstatements in to Xero.
